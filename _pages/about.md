I am Shangrun Lu, a Ph.D. student at the [School of Materials Science and Engineering](https://www.mse.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research focuses on magnetic skyrmions, including micromagnetic simulations and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. With a solid academic foundation and hands-on experience, I am dedicated to advancing the understanding and applications of magnetic materials.

Purpose of This Website
======

The purpose of this website is to share my academic journey and insights. I will publish my experiment reports, project summaries, and updates on my research directions and achievements. Additionally, I will share moments from my life, including experiences at academic conferences, group activities, and happy dates with my girlfriend.

I am fortunate to be part of an excellent research group where everyone is enthusiastic and collaborative. My advisor, Professor [Licong Peng](https://www.mse.pku.edu.cn/info/1213/2411.htm), is not only highly knowledgeable but also very kind and supportive.

Feel free to contact me for discussions or collaborations, and I warmly welcome anyone interested in joining Professor Peng's research group!
