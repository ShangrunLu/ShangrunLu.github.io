I am Shangrun Lu, a Ph.D. student at the [School of Materials Science and Engineering](https://www.mse.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research focuses on magnetic skyrmions, including micromagnetic simulations and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. With a solid academic foundation and hands-on experience, I am dedicated to advancing the understanding and applications of magnetic materials.

I am fortunate to be part of an excellent research group where everyone is enthusiastic and collaborative. My advisor, [Prof. Licong Peng](https://www.mse.pku.edu.cn/info/1213/2411.htm), is not only highly knowledgeable but also very kind and supportive.

My Academic Journey
======

I will complete my undergraduate studies at the [School of Physics](https://spe.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), majoring in Physics, in 2025. My academic foundation includes the four core branches of mechanics and solid-state physics. I developed a strong interest in advanced quantum mechanics and group theory, with a deep passion for theoretical derivations.

I have also participated in numerous experimental courses, including Fundamental Physics Experiments, Fundamental Physics Design Experiments, Modern Physics Experiments, Electronic Technology Experiments, Comprehensive Electronic Design Experiments, Physics Specialized Experiments, Optical Information Specialized Experiments, Physics Independent Design Experiments, and Optical Information Independent Design Experiments. These experiences have honed my skills in both experimental techniques and programming.

The research projects I have undertaken cover a broad range of topics, such as superconducting quantum circuits, quantum optics, ultracold atoms, surface physics, magnetic metasurfaces, and femtosecond laser micro-nano fabrication. Reports and outcomes from these projects can be found under the "[Sharing](https://shangrunlu.github.io/teaching/)" section of this website.
