Diffraction is a fundamental phenomenon in optics. Deriving an analytical solution for the diffraction of complex apertures is generally challenging. To obtain the Fraunhofer diffraction patterns of complex 
apertures, the ear-clipping method is employed to approximate the aperture by dividing it into multiple triangles. Consequently, the total diffraction field of the aperture can be expressed as a superposition of the diffraction fields of these triangles. The Fourier transform of each arbitrary triangle is computed by converting it, through coordinate transformation, into the Fourier transform of a basic right triangle. Subsequently, an experimental setup for Fraunhofer diffraction was constructed to measure the diffraction field distribution for different apertures. The angular distribution uncertainty was calculated to analyze the diffraction field of regular polygonal apertures, verifying the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed analytical algorithm. Finally, the diffraction field of complex fractal apertures was computed, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in calculating diffraction fields of complex apertures.
