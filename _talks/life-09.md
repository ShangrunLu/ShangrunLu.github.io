On November 7, 2023, my classmates, professors, and I participated in the National Undergraduate Physics Experiment Competition (Innovation Category) held at Chongqing University. Through teamwork and determination, we achieved the First Prize, a testament to our collective effort and dedication. It was a proud and unforgettable experience.
